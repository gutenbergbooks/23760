<p><span class="sc">The German Crown Prince</span> has the
mumps. It seems that his Imperial
Father was not consulted in the matter
beforehand, and further domestic differences
are anticipated.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">King Sisovath</span> of Cambodia, we
learn from <i>Le Petit Journal</i>, was so
pleased with a white elephant sent him
by the Governor-General of French
Indo-China that he has raised the
animal&mdash;a fine female&mdash;to the dignity
of a Princess. The news soon got
about, and considerable jealousy is felt
at our Zoo, where there is not so much
as even a baronet among the inmates.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>General <span class="sc">von Plettenburgh</span>, commanding
the Prussian Guards Corps,
has issued a decree against the wearing
of the so-called "tooth-brush" moustache,
pointing out that such an
appendage is unsuitable for a Prussian
soldier and "not consonant with the
German national character." The implication
is very unpleasant.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"It is generally reported," says a
contemporary, "that Sir <span class="sc">Edward Grey</span>
speaks no German, and French very
badly. <span class="sc">M. Venizelos</span>, the Greek
Prime Minister, declared that he had
the greatest difficulty in understanding
Sir <span class="sc">Edward's</span> French." As a matter
of fact a little bird tells us that on this
occasion our Foreign Secretary was
speaking Greek.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Mr. Asquith," said <i>The Times</i>,
"in a massage to the Liberal candidate
for South Bucks, emphasizes the prime
importance of the Irish issue." There
is, of course, nothing like massage for
rubbing things in.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Herr <span class="sc">Ballin</span>, head of the Hamburg-American
Line, and Herr <span class="sc">Heineken</span>,
head of the rival North-German Lloyd
Company, came to London last week,
and are said to have concluded peace
in the Atlantic rate war. We understand
that the arrangement is to be
known as the Pool of London.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The authorities at Barotse, <i>The Globe</i>
tells us, have put a price on the heads
of all lions there. One can picture the
mean sportsman, with a pair of field-glasses,
picking out the cheapest before
firing.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<blockquote><p>"61,000 <span class="sc">Territorials Short</span>."</p>

<p><i>Daily Mail.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Still, it is pretty generally recognised
now that a small man may make every
bit as good a soldier as a big one, and,
besides, there is always less of him to hit.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Among the temporary teachers appointed
to carry on schools in Herefordshire
during the teachers' strike was
an asylum attendant. This confirms
the report that many of the children
were mad at finding that the schools did
not close in consequence of the strike.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It is denied that the name of the
Philharmonic Hall, where Mr. <span class="sc">Ponting's</span>
moving pictures of the Antarctic
Expedition are being shown, is to be
changed to the Philmharmonic Hall.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="sc">Richard Strauss's</span> new work, dealing
with the story, of <span class="sc">Joseph</span> and <span class="sc">Potiphar's</span>
wife, is to be produced shortly
in Paris. A musical play version of it,
entitled "After the Man," may be
looked for here.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>From Rome comes the news that a
young man who was being examined
in a hospital there has been found to
have two separate stomachs. This
announcement that the ideal man has
at last been evolved has caused the
greatest excitement here in Corporation
circles.</p>

<h2>THE GREAT RESIGNER.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Forecast.</i>)</p>

<p><i>March, 1914.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. <span class="sc">William O'Brien</span> describes Mr. <span class="sc">John Redmond</span>
as "brother to the middle-aged sea-serpent from the
County Clare."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">John Redmond</span> denies that he is a sea-serpent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">William O'Brien</span>, having denounced this denial
as "the last effort of a defeated dastard," resigns his seat
for Cork City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">O'Brien</span> is re-elected without a contest.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>April, 1914.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. <span class="sc">William O'Brien</span> in an impassioned speech advocates
conciliation all round in Ireland, and refers to Mr.
<span class="sc">John Redmond</span> as "a moth-eaten, moss-gathering malingerer
of unparalleled ferocity."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Redmond</span> is seen to smile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">O'Brien</span>, declaring that he has never been so
much insulted in his life, resigns his seat for Cork City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">O'Brien</span> is re-elected without a contest.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>May, 1914.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>An Alderman of Cork fails to take off his hat to Mr.
<span class="sc">O'Brien</span>.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">O'Brien</span> summons a meeting of his supporters
and, in a five-hours' speech, states that, in spite of the
unexampled infamy of Mr. <span class="sc">Redmond</span>, he will never
abandon his efforts for Irish unity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Redmond</span> says nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">O'Brien</span> states that "the truckling truculence of
a mock-modest monster of meretricious mendacity cannot
be allowed to prevail against a policy of sober and sympathetic
silence."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Redmond</span> having abstained from a reply, Mr.
<span class="sc">O'Brien</span> resigns his seat for Cork City and is shortly
afterwards re-elected without a contest.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>June, 1914.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>, in moving the Second Reading of the
Home Rule Bill, does not mention Mr. <span class="sc">O'Brien</span>, who
swoons in his place and is carried speechless from the
House of Commons.</p>

<p>On the following day Mr. <span class="sc">O'Brien</span> issues to the world
a manifesto of 60,000 words, in which he describes Mr.
<span class="sc">Redmond</span> as "a palsied purveyor of pledge-breaking
platitudes," and announces that the Irish question can
be settled only by the good will of men of all parties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Redmond</span> takes no notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">O'Brien</span> declares that he can no longer pursue a
policy of conciliation and mildness, and resigns his seat
for Cork City as a protest against the "frenzied flaunting
of flattery and folly" in which, he says, Mr. <span class="sc">Redmond</span>
spends his time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">O'Brien</span>, having been re-elected without a contest,
immediately re-resigns twelve times in advance.</p></blockquote>

<h2>CINEMA NEWS.</h2>

<p>Final preparations have now been made to film Mr.
<span class="sc">Thornton's</span> first day as General Manager of the Great
Eastern Railway. By kind permission of Lord <span class="sc">Claud
Hamilton</span> representatives of all the other railway companies
are to be present to take notes, like the foreign military
attach&eacute;s in a war. A good "movie" should result.</p>

<hr />

<p>Another film which should provide entertainment and
instruction in the highest degree is the "Day in the Life of
Mr. <span class="sc">C. K. Shorter</span>" which is now being arranged for. The
great critic will be followed hour by hour with faithful
persistence. He will be seen editing <i>The Sphere</i> with one
hand and putting all the writing fellows in their place with
the other. He will be seen in that wonderful library of
his which covers two acres in St. John's Wood, reading,
annotating and correcting; he will be seen at lunch at his
club with other intellectual kings, his intimate friends;
shaking hands with Mr. <span class="sc">Hardy</span>; entering a taxi; leaving a
taxi and paying the fare; dining with Sir <span class="sc">W. Robertson
Nicoll</span>; attending a first night and applauding only when
applause is merited; and finally returning home to read
more books. In all, about fourteen miles.</p>

<hr />

<p>It will be regretfully learned by the great public, always
ready for new thrillers, that all efforts to induce Mr.
<span class="sc">Balfour</span> to part with the cinema rights of his Gifford
lectures have failed.</p>

<h2>MUSICAL DIAGNOSIS.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Dr. James Cantlie</span> has reported
that "the placing of a tuning-fork;
against the body of a patient enables
him to gauge the limits of the liver
with almost hair-breadth precision."
He believes that musical diagnosis will
prove reliable in the case of broken
bones, and asserts that already it has
been proved that a fatty liver gives
out tones distinct from a cirrhosed
liver.</p>

<p>A superb performance of Herr <span class="sc">Richard
Strauss's</span> "German Measles Concerto"
was given last night by the Queen's
Hall orchestra. The tempo was throughout
wonderfully high. The three fine
solo passages for the left kidney were
finely rendered; while the exquisite
<i>diminuendo</i> to convalescence with
which the work concludes greatly impressed
a neurotic audience.</p>

<p>The tuning-fork test has proved that
several of the most popular of recent
rag-time tunes were originally scored
by the brain of a patient who had met
with a severe concussion while attempting
to escape over the high wall of an
Asylum for Incurable Idiots.</p>

<p>An interesting incident is reported in
the Medical press from a well-known
Nursing Home. It appears that one
of the female attendants, on applying
the tuning-fork to what was alleged to
be the broken heart of a patient, was
astonished to obtain as response the
first five bars of "You Made Me Love
You." The case has, we learn, been
since discharged cured.</p>

<hr />

<h2>NUPTIAL NOVELTIES.</h2>

<blockquote><p>["Two prominent members of the Herne
Bay Angling Association were married on
Saturday afternoon at St. Martin's Church,
Herne Bay.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of the wedding was
the assembly of members of the association,
who lined the pathway to the church door and
formed an archway of fishing-rods, to which
silver horseshoes had been attached.</p>

<p>The bridegroom's father is not only president
of the angling association, but captain of the
Herne Bay Fire Brigade, members of which
formed a guard of honour with crossed
hatchets."&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p>The nuptials of Mr. Desmond Waddilove
and Miss Esther Priddie, whose
parents are prominently implicated in
the milk trade, were marked by several
interesting and appropriate spectacular
incidents. A specially attractive feature
was the progress of the wedding procession
between a double row of milk-cans.
Later on the bride and bridegroom
left for Cowes (I.W.) amid a volley of
pats of butter deftly hurled by the
officials of the Sursum Corda Dairy
Company, Ltd.</p>

<p>Last Saturday the wedding of Mr.
Nestor Young and Miss Leonora
Dargle was celebrated with great <i>&eacute;clat</i>
at St. Mark's, Datchet. Out of respect
for the calling of the bride's father all
the wedding party proceeded to the
sacred edifice in bath-chairs, which
imparted to the ceremony an air of
solemnity too often neglected at up-to-date
weddings. The bridegroom's
father being a leading pork-butcher,
imitation sausages formed part of the
trimmings of the bride's going-away
dress.</p>

<p>Mr. Donald MacLurkin, the golf
professional of the Culbin Sands Golf
Club, was married last Friday at
Lossiemouth to Miss Janet Sutor, of
Cromarty. A charming effect was
produced by a guard of honour, composed
of members of the golf club,
holding aloft crossed brassies, beneath
which the happy pair passed into the
church, while the caddies clashed
niblicks and other iron clubs. The
bride wore a cream silk bogey skirt,
slightly caught up so as to show the
pink dots of the stymied underskirt,
and a simple Dunlop V corsage. A
dainty little pot-bunker hat completed
a costume as novel as it was natty.</p>

<hr />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg 146]</span><h2>THE ROYALISTS.</h2>

<p>Eight of us travel up to town every
morning by the Great Suburban Railway.
I have no politics. Gibbs is a
Unionist Free Trader. Three of the
others are Radicals and three Unionists.
On one side of the compartment are
ranged <i>The Daily Mail</i>, <i>The Daily
Express</i> and <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>.
Boldly confronting them are two <i>Daily
Chronicles</i> and a <i>Daily News</i>. Gibbs
contents himself with a <i>Daily Graphic</i>,
while I choose every day the paper
with the least sensational
placard.</p>

<p>You can imagine what the
journeys are like. Filmer will
put down his <i>Daily Express</i>
and say with feeling, "If I
could only get that infernal
Welsher by the throat." Then
Rodgers will lay down his
<i>Daily News</i> and sneer, "What
has aggravated the toadies of
the Dukes to-day?" In a
moment the battle is in full
swing. Bennett breaks in
with assertions that peace and
unity will never prevail till
the Cabinet has been hanged.
Chalmers makes a mild proposal
for the imprisonment
of the Armament Ring which
is gnawing at the country's
vitals. And when there has
been a by-election and both
sides claim the moral victory
I have no doubt that the men
in signal-boxes think that
murder is taking place in our
carriage.</p>

<p>However, one day Filmer
made a reference to Marconi
speculations which caused
Rodgers to shake the dust
from his feet (an easy thing
on the Great Suburban line)
and leave the compartment
at the next station. Then
Chalmers and Simcox bore down on
Filmer with statistics about our booming
trade. When we reached the next
station, Filmer darted out of the compartment,
declining to travel any longer
with a set of miserable Cobdenite Little
Englanders. I was horrified&mdash;not at
the absence of Rodgers and Filmer,
which could have been endured&mdash;but at
the idea that the gaps they left in the
carriage might be tilled up by even
worse persons than politicians. Suppose
golfers took their places. On one
occasion, when Gibbs had influenza,
an intruder had described to us the
fixing of a new carburettor to his car.</p>

<p>Then the great idea came to me&mdash;the
formation of the Society. The next
morning I went up to Filmer and
Rodgers as they stood apart from
us and each other on the platform
and said, "Come to the others for a
moment. They want to apologise
to you."</p>

<p>They didn't, but sometimes one has
to choose between the cause of peace
and that of truth.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," I said, "I have noticed
this. Nearly all our little controversies
begin in one way. Somebody says,
'I call a spade a spade and <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span>
(or <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>) a lying, treacherous
scoundrel.' I propose that we form
ourselves into the Society for Not
Calling a Spade a Spade."</p>

<p>"What do you propose to call it?
'A Royal'?" This from Gibbs, who
is a master of auction bridge.</p>

<p>"By all means," I said. "It gives
dignity and an enhanced value to a
vulgar agricultural utensil. And the
Society can be called 'The Royalists' for
short. Its single rule is to be this, that
any member speaking of any politician
of the opposite Party except in terms
of eulogy shall be fined ten shillings
and sixpence. The fines to be divided
equally between the Tariff Reform
League and the Free Trade Union."</p>

<p>For a moment there was hesitation.
Then the Opposition rejoiced at the
idea of hearing the Radicals praise <span class="sc">Law</span>
and <span class="sc">Long</span>, and the Radicals thought it
would be ecstasy to hear panegyrics of
<span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> and <span class="sc">Masterman</span> from
the Unionists.</p>

<p>The Society was formed at once and
has proved an enormous success. Peace
and goodwill reign amongst us. It is
a perpetual delight to see Filmer put
down his <i>Daily Express</i> and with the
veins bulging out from his forehead
say, "That accurate and careful
financier who has so immeasurably
raised the status of the Chancellorship
of the Exchequer"; or to hear
Chalmers remark, "Sad
would it be if that most
honey-tongued and softhearted
of politicians, dear
<span class="sc">F. E. Smith</span>, should have
his life ended by a British
bayonet."</p>

<p>One or two prepare their
delicate eulogies beforehand
and refer to notes; but this
is thought unfair. The compartment,
as a whole, prefers
the impromptu praise that
has the air of coming from
the heart.</p>

<p>I am thinking of offering to
the House of Commons and
the House of Lords free membership
in The Royalists.
Perhaps Messrs. <span class="sc">Lloyd
George</span> and <span class="sc">Leo Maxse</span>
would consent to act as
perpetual Joint Presidents,
with Lord <span class="sc">Hugh Cecil</span> and
the Rev. Dr. <span class="sc">Clifford</span> as
Chaplains.</p>

<h2>THE INVADERS.</h2>

<p>From all sides news pours in concerning the rush for
American managers of English concerns. At last the excellence
of the American businessman's habits are being
recognised, probably not a little owing to the vogue of such
plays as <i>Get-rich-quick Wallingford</i>, <i>Broadway Jones</i> and
<i>The Fortune Hunters</i>, wherein we see hustling methods
justifying by their success all the odd measures which led
to dollars. That the dominating business man who thus
rises to greatness has to marry a clerk or typist is perhaps
only a detail, but if the plays are to be taken as a guide it
is expected of him.</p>

<p>The great tailoring house of Tarn, which has just appointed
a manager from Cleveland, Ohio, on the advice of
Lord <span class="sc">Claud Hamilton</span>, has completely transformed its
cutting department. All jackets are now made to reach to
the knees, with shoulders that project beyond the wearer's
body one foot on each side. The trousers are wide at
the knees and tight at the ankles, and are very effective.
Walking-sticks must not be worn with these suits. Messrs.
Tarn hope to bring back the frock coat very shortly, especially
for politicians.</p>

<p>The American scholar who has just been appointed to
the Chair of English Composition at Oxford has already
made some drastic reforms. No longer may the student
write that he has a book "at home"; he must say "to
home." The participle "got" has gone in favour of "gotten";
while the only text-books in use are of Trans-Atlantic origin.
The University has adopted the college cry of "No,
No, No Eng Lish Need, Need, Need Apply!"</p>

<p>This yell will be used by Oxford partisans at the Inter-University
Sports during the performances of American
<span class="sc">Rhodes</span> Scholars.</p>

<p>The latest news to reach us as we go to press is that the
directors of various London music halls are thinking
seriously whether or not they will call in American assistance
for their revues, either producers, actors or musicians.
But this is an innovating step which will require the
deepest thought.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg 148]</span><h2>AN APOLOGY THAT MADE
THINGS WORSE.</h2>

<p>We had a fancy-dress ball on
December 30th. They have these
things in nearly all Swiss Hotels and
you have to put up with them. As a
matter of fact Matilda and I enjoyed
ourselves. We supped well and danced
quite often. At 3.30 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> we set out
for our rooms. We took a lighted
candle with us to keep us warm as
we went. The way to get the most
warmth from a candle is to sit round
it. As the corridor was cold, we sat
round the candle outside Miss Wortley's
room, but this was quite accidental.</p>

<p>We didn't know that she had gone
to bed at 10.30 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> with the primary
object of sleeping and the ulterior
motive of getting up the next morning
in time to catch an early train. We
weren't to know that she had wasted
her time from 11 <span class="sc">p.m.</span> to 3.25 <span class="sc">a.m.</span>
listening to a procession of revellers
retiring to their rooms. We had no
suspicion that she was just dozing off
for the first time when we stopped
to warm ourselves. We really made
very little noise, though we may have
laughed just a little. The report which
has got about, that I tried to climb up
the wall to see the time, is inaccurate.
The clock is not nearly high enough up
the wall to render this necessary, and
I didn't care a button what the time
was.</p>

<p>If we had known that the Germans
who ought to have been asleep in the
room opposite to Miss Wortley would
come out into the corridor and shout
in their nasty guttural language, we
should probably not have tried to find
out whether anything was attached to
the other end of a piece of tape that
protruded from under their door. It
was quite a long piece of tape, and
there was something attached to the
end of it, though we never found out
what that something was. Anyway,
it was too large to pass under the
door, though we pulled the tape quite
hard. We had just given up our
investigation and reached our respective
rooms when the German family arrived
in the corridor and commented on the
matter.</p>

<p>I can't see that we were really to
blame because Miss Wortley suffered
from insomnia, missed her early train
next morning and had to pay an extra
half franc for having breakfast in her
bedroom. She was very unpleasant
about it and went round telling everybody
that we had kept her awake all
night. She was one of those women
who&mdash;&mdash;But there, I don't want to be
nasty, and anyone who reads this will
guess the kind of woman she was.</p>

<p>The next day was New Year's Eve.
After dinner we took part in an Ice
Carnival, then we saw the New Year in,
and then we drank practically everybody's
health. At 2 <span class="sc">a.m.</span> I was sitting
in the lounge talking to Matilda when
a kind of peaceful sensation came over
me, and I began to be sorry that there
was any bad feeling between Miss
Wortley and us; so I said to Matilda,
It's New Year's Day and I should
like to start it on friendly terms with
everyone, including Miss Wortley. I
think I shall apologise to her about
last night; we may have been a little
thoughtless."</p>

<p>"I don't see what there is to apologise
for," said Matilda, "but I suppose it
can't do any harm and it may help to
make things pleasant all round. If
you're going to apologise I suppose I
ought to do the same."</p>

<p>"Come on then," I said.</p>

<p>"Where to?"</p>

<p>"To apologise."</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd; we can't apologise
now. We'll apologise to-morrow."</p>

<p>"We might miss her to-morrow, and
we ought to do a thing like this without
delay and as early in the New
Year as possible. If I don't do it now,
I may not feel apologetic later on, and
I don't want to go through the year
with even a tittle of Miss Wortley's
insomnia on my conscience."</p>

<p>Matilda seemed rather uncertain
about it, but after a time recognised
that I was right, and we went up to
Miss Wortley's room. I had to knock
loudly on her door before I got any
answer, but eventually a sleepy voice
said, "Come in."</p>

<p>I didn't think that we had better do
that, so I knocked again.</p>

<p>"All right, you can bring in the
water."</p>

<p>"It isn't exactly your shaving water&mdash;in
fact it's hardly time to get up
yet," I shouted.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Is the place
on fire?" I heard sounds as of a person
getting out of bed, so I said, "You
needn't get up, it's only us. We
wanted to apologise about last night.
We're sorry you didn't sleep very well.
Of course it wasn't altogether our
fault, but still we thought that we
should like to apologise; in fact we
didn't feel that we could go to sleep
until we had apologised; and&mdash;and we
wanted to wish you a Happy New
Year."</p>

<p>I am not sure that I did the thing
very well, but I am sure that it would
have sounded better and that I shouldn't
have ended so lamely if Matilda hadn't
been so tactless as to laugh in the
middle. Somehow I got the idea that
the apology hadn't been accepted in
the spirit in which it had been tendered.
Suspicious sounds came from within,
including the click of a water jug;
also the German family opposite seemed
to be under the impression that it was
time to get up&mdash;so we didn't wait to
say Good-night, but slipped quietly out
of the way. Miss Wortley's door and the
door opposite opened simultaneously.
There were two splashes like water
thrown from jugs, and I fancy that
more than one person got wet. It
isn't easy to discover exactly what is
happening when two people are shouting
at the tops of their voices in
different languages, but I didn't gather
that they quite cleared the matter up
to their mutual satisfaction.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="sc">Extracted from the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span>)</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, February
16.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Worthington Evans</span> charmed
House to-day by one of those little
delicacies of feeling and taste favoured
in the assembly. <span class="sc">Masterman</span> has met
the reward of conspicuous success at
the Treasury by promotion to Cabinet
rank. In his absence his place temporarily
taken at Question Time by
<span class="sc">Wedgwood Benn</span>, who, while careful
to deprecate personal responsibility for
promise to give 9<i>d.</i> for 4<i>d.</i>, displayed
remarkable intimacy with intricacies
of the Insurance Act. <span class="sc">Worthington
Evans</span>, having as usual, after the leisure
of a week-end, provided himself with
collection of conundrums
based on its working, knew
that when he came down
to-day he would find
<span class="sc">Masterman's</span> seat empty.</p>

<p>Marked the occasion by
presenting himself in
mourning array&mdash;not the
profoundest black such as
<i>Hamlet</i> upon occasion
affected, but a prevalence
of decorous colour provided
in what is known in
drapers' shops as "The
Mitigated Affliction Department."
An uncompromising
black tie was a determining
note in his attire,
testifying to sincere regret
at parting from a Minister
whom for three Sessions
he has, so to speak, riddled
with conundrums.</p>

<p>Insurance Act has suddenly
again sprung into prominence.
By odd accident revival is
coincident with couple of by-elections
going forward in Metropolis. <span class="sc">Joynson-Hicks</span>
much struck by circumstance
that announcement of scheme under
the Act dealing with casual labour
at the docks is promulgated just
now, when election is proceeding in
a constituency where there happen
to be many docks and a multitude of
casual labourers who have votes.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Bonner Law</span>, when he comes to
think of it, equally surprised. Would
the <span class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span>
oblige by explaining? As for <span class="sc">Lord
Bob Cecil</span>, he is so perturbed that he
momentarily forgets he has leading
question to address to <span class="sc">Premier</span> designed
to extract secret intention with respect
to amending Home Rule Bill.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lloyd George</span>, always ready to
oblige, explains that scheme in question
was prepared last Autumn, had frequently
been referred to by <span class="sc">Masterman</span>
whilst still at the Treasury.</p>

<p>"I am sure," he added, with twinkle
in his eye, "we owe a debt of gratitude
to Mr. <span class="sc">Joynson-Hicks</span> for calling
further attention to the matter at this
particular moment."</p>

<p>Opposition not to be put off by
badinage. Discover in apparently
innocent accident evidence of that
deep-seated tendency to import bribery
and corruption into by-elections of
which one of the Whips was this afternoon
made a terrible example.</p>

<p>Above and below Gangway Members
popped up desiring to put further
questions. Too much even for patience
of <span class="sc">Speaker</span>. Suggested matter had
better be raised upon debate.</p>

<p>"Why, cert'nly," said <span class="sc">Joynson-Hicks</span>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/153.png"><img width="100%" src="images/153.png" alt="" /></a><p class="center">Lord <span class="sc">Robert Cecil</span> is "perturbed."</p></div>

<p>Accordingly, when at eleven o'clock
debate on Address automatically stood
adjourned, and Members were anxious
to get home, the <span class="sc">Jocund Joynson</span> turned
up, and we had it all over again for
space of half-an-hour.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Ormsby-Gore</span> moved
amendment expressing regret that, in
spite of all they had heard to its
detriment in Lords and Commons,
Government intend to proceed with
Welsh Church Disestablishment Bill.
On division amendment negatived by
279 votes against 217. Reduction of
normal Ministerial majority hailed
with delight on Opposition benches.</p>

<p><i>House of Lords, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;"What's
this?" <span class="sc">Sark</span> asked, looking in at half-past
four and finding House crowded
with throng of strangers blocking
approaches. "Is it the Land or the
Church?"</p>

<p>"Neither," said <span class="sc">Marchamley</span>; "it's
Marconi."</p>

<p>"Ah," said <span class="sc">Sark</span>, as if that explained
everything.</p>

<p>On paper stood motion in name of
<span class="sc">Ampthill</span> for appointment of Select
Committee to enquire into relation of
Lord <span class="sc">Murray</span> with Marconi business.
The name, more blessed than Mesopotamia,
stirred glad Opposition to
profoundest depths. Thought it over
and done with; and here it was again,
blooming like the aloe, though after
briefer interval. Excitement broke
through ordinarily ice-bound calm of
the House.</p>

<p>Opposition benches crowded to fullest
capacity. Privy Councillors and sons
of Peers jostled each other on steps
of Throne. Peeresses flocked down
by the score. Curious effect of latest
fashion in headgear displayed in side
galleries. Nearly every bonnet&mdash;or
were they hats?&mdash;was
loftily plumed with black
feathers, ominously familiar
on hearses. It seemed as
if the ladies had come to
bury C&aelig;sar (of Elibank),
not to praise or even condemn
him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Murray</span>, arriving early,
passed the Front Bench,
where as ex-Minister he
had a right to sit. Found
a place immediately behind
in friendly contiguity to
former colleagues, Lord
<span class="sc">Crewe</span> and Lord <span class="sc">Morley</span>.
On stroke of half-past four
he rose and, producing sheaf
of manuscript, began to
read. In low voice, with
slow intonation, he turned
over page after page, each
scored with acknowledgment
of contrition and regret
for mistakes made. He
pleaded that "my error, such as it was,
was an error of judgment, not of
intention." As to purchase of American
Marconi shares on behalf of the Liberal
Party, "I have," he said, "myself
assumed the burden by taking over
these shares at the price paid for them
at the date of purchase, and, as the
House will appreciate, at very considerable
personal loss."</p>

<p>Throughout ten minutes he was on
his legs <span class="sc">Murray</span>, in unconscious sympathy
with the hearse plumes that
nodded over him from the side gallery
at his back, spoke in funereal note. In
the Commons so frank a confession, so
ample an apology, would have been
accepted with burst of general cheering.
Shrewd Members know that an assured
method of gaining temporary popularity
is to commit a breach of order and take
early opportunity of withdrawing anything
offensive that may have been
said, apologising for anything unseemly
that may have been done. When, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg 154]</span>example, <span class="sc">Ronald M'Neill</span> apologised
for having chucked at the head of the
<span class="sc">First Lord of the Admiralty</span> a book
containing rules for preservation of
order in debate, he was almost rapturously
cheered.</p>

<p>Chilliness of the graveyard froze
round <span class="sc">Murray</span> as he read carefully
prepared statement. When he sat down,
faint murmur of applause rose from
scanty muster on Liberal side. No
sound, whether of approval or disapproval,
broke the stillness
of the serried benches opposite.</p>

<p>Effect contagious. <span class="sc">Lansdowne</span>
almost inaudible.
<span class="sc">Crewe</span> quite so. Strangers
at back of gallery, hearing
no voice and seeing the
Noble Lord standing at the
table nervously wringing his
hands and twiddling his
fingers, thought he was conversing
with the <span class="sc">Leader of
the Opposition</span> by means of
the deaf and dumb alphabet.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Ampthill</span> above these evidences
of human weakness.
<span class="sc">Lansdowne</span> in characteristically
chivalrous manner
suggested that motion for
Committee should be withdrawn,
affording opportunity
to Noble Lords to consider
<span class="sc">Murray's</span> statement and the
best course to be taken upon
it. <span class="sc">Ampthill</span> not allured
by such considerations. As
he shrewdly remarked, if he
consented to withdraw his
motion it could not be revived.
All he would consent to was
not to insist upon proceeding
with business at to-day's
sitting. Stipulated that his
opportunity should not be
hampered by "unavoidable
delay."</p>

<p>On this understanding
House adjourned, hoarse
plumes in side galleries forlornly
nodding themselves out.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> at
bay in the Commons. His famous
Budget attacked afresh on motion
of Amendment to Address. <span class="sc">Ananias</span>
and <span class="sc">Sapphira</span> personally mentioned in
course of debate. Amendment negatived
by 301 votes against 213.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Upon inquiry and reflection
<span class="sc">Lansdowne</span> discovered that in
matter of proposed Marconi Committee
<span class="sc">Ampthill</span> is in fuller accord with
opinion of majority on his side of
House than himself. Accordingly,
adopts <span class="sc">Ampthill's</span> motion and moves
it. <span class="sc">Crewe</span> offering no opposition,
Committee appointed without division.</p>

<p>In Commons, just after 11 o'clock,
news came of defeat of <span class="sc">Masterman</span> in
Bethnal Green. Turns out there was
more in <span class="sc">Worthington Evans's</span> assumption
of "the inky cloak, good mother"
than on Monday met the eye. Boisterous
scene of exultation in Unionist camp,
jubilant cries of "Resign, Resign."
"Resign!" growled <span class="sc">Sark</span>. "Why
should <span class="sc">Wilson</span> resign a seat just won?
It is true it was in a three-cornered
fight, and by a majority of twenty-four
he represents minority of electors. But
the seat is his, and of course he'll keep
it."</p>

<p>Curious how obtuse <span class="sc">Sark</span> can be
upon occasion.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Debate on Address
agreed to in Commons. Forthwith
set to on Estimates. Work cut out till
31st March. After that Home Rule
and the Deluge.</p>

<h2>THE DEADLY BUTTON.</h2>

<p>We do not know whether the following
incident occurred at Signor <span class="sc">Ben
Trovato's</span> famous restaurant on Fifth
Avenue or not, but feel impelled, at
any rate, to quote it as a warning, on
the authority of <i>The Globe</i> of February
19th, and <i>The New York American</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Giving a well-satisfied sigh after
dinner a Pittsburg man burst a button off
his waistcoat. It split in two. One half
hit another man, with whom he was
dining, in the eye. As a result his <i>vis-&aacute;-vis</i>
may lose the sight of his eye.
The other half struck the convivo in
the cheek, cutting the flesh."</p>

<p>This new and hitherto unsuspected
possibility in ballistics must be rightly
directed and also guarded against.
There will be danger from the opposite
side of the table at City dinners at
about the tenth course and onwards,
unless the wary guest can screen himself
from the Corporation behind a
laager of fruit-dishes and substantial
ornaments.</p>

<p>If two gourmets fall out over the
respective merits of their favourite
<i>entremets</i>, the remedy is now easy.
There is the duel by button. Each of the
principals, seconded by his particular
waiter, after carefully taking his opponent's
range and bearings, will suspire
and hit him in the eye. The more
replete combatant, having the greater
equatorial velocity, will probably win,
but the tailor can do a good deal towards
securing a flat trajectory and
freedom from swerve.</p>

<p>At Christmas dinners, Tommy, when
adequately charged, can challenge a
rival amateur of plum-pudding to a
rally over the dessert, instead of expending
his horse-power over crackers. A
little training, of course, would be
needed to secure a combine fusillade.</p>

<p>It is only right to add that evening-dress
waistcoats are henceforward to
come under those sections of the Geneva
Convention which relate to missiles
and explosives. No soft-nosed buttons,
or studs which are liable to "bunch,"
are to be allowed. A special regulation
further requires that persons more than
fifty inches in circumference, and fire-eaters
who have already marked their
men, shall dine by themselves, or at
any rate only at a high table where
there is no <i>vis-&aacute;-vis</i>. And page-boys
are to be compelled to use hooks-and-eyes,
unless they are engaged for a
wedding or funeral salvo.</p>

<p>There is great entertainment at the

<span class="sc">Norman McKinnel</span>, among whom I
propose to count myself whenever, as so
rarely happens, he takes an evening off
from his tyrannical methods&mdash;seldom
very edifying when a woman is the
victim. As the gentleman says in one
of <span class="sc">Oscar Wendell Holmes's</span> books,
"<i>Quoiqu'elle soit tr&egrave;s solidement mont&eacute;e,
it ne faut pas brutaliser la machine</i>."
Here it is true that Mr. <span class="sc">McKinnel</span>
started out on his familiar courses, but he
soon found that he had to do with his
match; that <i>Helen's</i> hand was always
a little higher than his own. And, even
when we saw him at his most dogmatic,
the fact that the question of sex, in its
physical aspects, did not enter into
their relations&mdash;he was only her step-great-uncle&mdash;saved
us from a great
deal of uneasiness. In all his moods,
whether of blustering self-assertion or
reluctant surrender, of canny craft or
protesting generosity, Mr. <span class="sc">McKinnel</span>
was equally admirable.</p>

<p>The local atmosphere of the Five
Towns was established with less delay
over detail than is customary in this
kind. There was a lot of tea-drinking,
I admit, but no doubt this beverage
plays a strong part in the social life of
the Potteries. There was also much
handling of domestic provisions&mdash;streaky
bacon, cheese, and so forth&mdash;but
all this was proper enough in a
play that largely turned upon the
changes in an old celibate's <i>m&eacute;nage</i>.
But in the main it was a comedy of
character, a struggle between youth
and crabbed age, in which the younger
will and the quicker wit prevailed.
As we first see him, <i>James Ollerenshaw</i>
is a crusty, browbeating, misogynist,
hoarding his wealth, content with a
mean habit of life, and convinced that
nobody can get the better of him. As
we see him at the end he is a tamed
man, dependent on female protection
against the wiles of a designing widow,
and established, at great cost, with his
niece in the noble and ancient mansion
of her desire. There were subsidiary
love-episodes, of course, but these,
though novel in some particulars, were
relatively perfunctory. The character
of <i>James Ollerenshaw</i> was the real
matter of resistance.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="sc">Nancy Price's</span> <i>Helen</i> was a
very probable performance. For myself
I found her a little too minx-eyed for my
taste, but no doubt this was part of the
right Pottery touch. Minor characters
were all brightly played, Miss <span class="sc">Mi&egrave;le
Maund</span> being particularly happy as a
garrulous young girl in the first flush
of an engagement, who subsequently
throws over her violent <i>fianc&eacute;</i> on the
ground that "she could never marry a
man who pushes people into lakes."
Even the <i>vieux jeu</i> of the designing
widow took on a certain freshness in
the robust bands of Miss <span class="sc">Rosina
Filippi</span>.</p>

<p>I am in the fortunate position of having
yet to read Mr. <span class="sc">Arnold Bennett's</span>
novel, from which Mr. <span class="sc">Pryce's</span> comedy
has been adapted, and am therefore free
to treat the play itself on what I take
to be its merits. It may be that the
adapter assumed in us a little previous
knowledge of the history of <i>Helen's</i>
love affair, or that at least there was
an obscurity about her past that wanted
clearing up by retrospective illumination;
but that is my only possible
criticism; and I heartily congratulate
the Vaudeville management on having
at last discovered a play that promises
to reward their enterprise.</p>

<p>Not suspecting that there would be
a change of hours after the second
night, I arrived on the third night
punctually at 8, to find that the performance
was announced to begin at
8.30. Punctually at that hour I returned,
to find that it did not commence
till 9; that in the meantime I was to
assist at a song-and-talk recital of
which no threat had been published.
My quarrel is not with Mr. <span class="sc">Frederic
Norton</span> who did it, though his clever
entertainment began with some songs
about fishes and things that might have
warmed a Penny Readings' audience
but left me bitterly cold. My complaint
is of a wasted hour and a bolted dinner.
I mention it only to prove that, whatever
the provocation he has suffered, a
Dramatic Critic is incapable of prejudice.</p>

<h2>THE EXPERT IN EXCELSIS.</h2>

<p>The invitation to Mr. <span class="sc">Arthur Brock</span>, the well-known
pyrotechnist, to express his opinion of <span class="sc">Stravinsky's</span> orchestral
fantasia, "Fireworks," on the occasion of its
second performance at Queen's Hall on the 28th inst.,
has, we are delighted to learn, been fruitful of a series of
similar invitations, not only in the sphere of music but also
in the domain of art and letters.</p>

<p>Thus we understand that the place of the ordinary
musical critic of <i>The Times</i> will be taken at the next performance
of <i>Parsifal</i> by Mr. <span class="sc">Waterer</span>, the great floricultural
expert, and Mr. <span class="sc">Devant</span>, the eminent conjurer,
with a view to their contributing their impressions of the
flower maidens and the methods of the magician <i>Klingsor</i>
respectively.</p>

<p>Similarly, on the occasion of the next representation of
<span class="sc">Wagner's</span> <i>Flying Dutchman</i> at Covent Garden, a signed
criticism by the Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the
Great Western Railway will appear in the pages of our
contemporary.</p>

<p>The practice, which it is hoped will lend additional
brightness to the vivacious criticisms of <i>The Times</i>, is not
to be confined to Opera. The <span class="sc">Astronomer-Royal</span> will be
asked to record his impressions of <span class="sc">Beethoven's</span> "Moonlight
Sonata", and the officials of our leading lightships
will be asked to report upon <span class="sc">Parry's</span> "Blest Pair of Sirens."</p>

<p>The application of the new method to literature promises
to be equally interesting. It is an open secret that Messrs.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg 158]</span><h2>A CHARACTER.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;Under the title
of "A Bygone" you recently published
the tale of a certain estimable butler
and his one lapse, during many years'
service, into alcoholism. This reminds
me of the shorter and sharper history
of our own James, who came to our
Northern home on a Monday afternoon
and left upon the following morning.</p>

<p>For his chief characteristics be referred
us, on application, to the opinion
of a (Mrs.) Elizabeth Brown, of "The
Cottage," Bamston, near Maidstone,
Kent, who, he said, knew more about
him than anybody else, and would take
him back into her service later if need
and opportunity arose. This opinion
described him briefly but emphatically
as honest, sober and willing. By way
of the usual caution we wrote to this
good lady direct and asked her to be so
kind as to elaborate her views to us in
confidence. In reply she wrote that
James had been with her for eleven
years on and off, had left her only
because she was leaving "The Cottage,"
would be welcomed back by her when
she settled down again, and meanwhile
was very honest, very sober and very
willing. There was that about the
handwriting and style of this letter
which made us feel that the writer
might not be one of the old <i>noblesse</i>,
but was, at any rate, a kindly, sensible
and acute old body, who knew now and
always what she was talking about.
Moreover it indicated, but did not
actually state, that the man had come
to be regarded in the writer's household
with feelings more friendly than
those usually found between employer
and employ&eacute;: always, we thought, a
strong recommendation of an old servant.
On the strength of this correspondence
we decided to give him a
trial at least.</p>

<p>There was nothing peculiar about
his appearance, except the suggestion
of a secret sorrow, which was no business
of ours. His willingness was at
once apparent: our house being full
for a hunt ball there was plenty of
work for him to do, but even so he
found time between tea and dinner to
put in a preliminary polish of the silver,
which, he told us, was his chief joy in
life, or rather one of them. Moreover
he refused to go to bed until our return
from the ball, timed not to be earlier
than 4 <span class="sc">a.m.</span>, and insisted that he would
sit up for us.</p>

<p>We drove off after dinner without a
qualm; for, though my wife declares
that she detected a suspicious smell of
spirits as he put the carriage rug over
her, unhappily she did not think to
mention this till the next day. When
we got back in the small hours we
found that, in accordance with his
promise, he had indeed not gone to
bed. There he was unmistakably in the
hall. But he wasn't sitting up....
No.... Rather, he was lying down,
back uppermost.... So much for his
sobriety.</p>

<p>We resolved to show no mercy.
Having promised to drive Captain
Merriman, one of our guests, to the
station to catch the early train to London,
I was myself up betimes to see
the sinful James also off the premises.
His sorrow, no longer secret, was very
manifest; it was a cold wet morning;
it required some strength of mind to
cast the fellow adrift and leave him to
find his own way, with bag and
baggage, to oblivion. But I did it.</p>

<p>One does not leave much margin of
time on these occasions, and it was not
long afterwards that we followed in the
dog-cart; nor had we got far on our
road before we espied the back of James
ahead of us&mdash;one of the saddest backs
I have ever seen. He had still four
miles to go to the station; his bag was
obviously not light; he looked as if he
would not get four more yards without
collapsing; no doubt he had had an
exhaustive night; finally, even that
stern disciplinarian, Merriman, took
pity. So, "Jump up behind, you old
blackguard," I called to him as I drew
up alongside, and up he climbed, cling-to
his seedy bag and protesting that
this was very much more than he
deserved.</p>

<p>As to his honesty you, Sir, must
judge. The police doubted it from the
start, and their experience led them to
be sure that the reference was forged,
that there was no "Cottage" and no
Elizabeth Brown. No doubt he had
managed to get our letter delivered to
him and had forged an answer to
that. On all points they were wrong
and James was correct. There was
"The Cottage" all right, very much a
cottage; it had been vacated by the
tenant, not voluntarily (who ever said
it had?) but by reason of arrears of
six weeks' rent, at 5<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per week.
The tenant's name was truly Elizabeth
Brown, though she was more commonly
known as Old Bess, and she was
the one person to know all about our
James, being his wife. And we've no
reason to doubt that she has taken him
back into her service and was very glad
to do it too.</p>

<p>In short, I cannot claim that James
lied to us in any particular. So much
for his honesty. As far as dishonesty
was involved in the matter of the bag,
I am not in a position to complain of
that, seeing that it was by my agency
alone that that bag got to the station,
and it was at my expense that our local
porter deposited, <i>inter alia</i>, my wife's
much valued Georgian tea service and
spoons in the London train, just about
the time that the theft of them was
being discovered at home. Under the
guilty circumstances I prefer to remain</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p><i>The Golden Barrier</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>) was an affair of
sovereigns, and the way of it was this. <i>Magdalen Tempest</i>,
the heroine, had been left by her late father the mistress
of many fine houses, and stacks and stacks of money. She
had inherited also a disagreeable but honest butler, an
aunt who was even more disagreeable but not honest, and
an agent who was&mdash;well, who was the hero of the book.
She had further gathered to herself a crowd of hangers-on
more or less artistic, and all given to requiring small
temporary loans. One of them, however, was a professed
social reformer, a bold bad man of doubtful extraction, who
was leagued with the aunt in a plan to marry <i>Magdalen</i> to
himself and secure control of the cash. So <i>Magdalen</i> gave
a Venetian Carnival in her great house, and it came on to
thunder, and she found herself alone in a gondola with the
painter (favourite hanger-on), who attempted, too vigorously,
to improve the shining hour, and it was all rather awkward,
when&mdash;romantically opportune arrival of the hero (name of
<i>Denvers</i>), who flung the painter into the lake, clasped the
heroine in his manly arms, married her and lived happy&mdash;&mdash;No.
That is where you are too hasty. There remained
still the Golden Barrier. For, after an interlude of bliss,
back came the intriguing aunt, the social reformer and all
the crowd (save the submerged artist) and began to accuse
<i>Denvers</i> of living on his wife's cheque-book. How it ends
you must find out. If you object that there is very little
in all this to suggest the spirit of fine romance which you
have learnt to associate with the names of <span class="sc">Agnes</span> and
<span class="sc">Egerton Castle</span>, I can only say that (while my rough
synopsis does no justice to some pleasant characterization)
I myself greatly prefer these two writers in their earlier
and brocaded mood.</p>

<hr />

<p>It seems to me that Mr. <span class="sc">Francis Brett-Young</span> has done
quite a distinguished piece of work in <i>Deep Sea</i> (<span class="sc">Secker</span>).
I have not cared to miss a paragraph of it and have certainly
carried away an unusually vivid memory of that unnamed
West-country fishing-town which he has so cleverly peopled
with his creatures&mdash;with poor, simple, introspective <i>Jeffrey
Kenar</i>, fisherman that was, looking at life through the
oddly refracting medium of his window of old glass, and all
but seeing visions; comely, bitter <i>Nesta</i>, his wife; simple,
loyal <i>Reuben</i>, <i>Jeffrey's</i> friend, whose rejection of <i>Nesta
Kenar's</i> overmastering passion turns her love to hate;
<i>Reuben's</i> gentle wife, <i>Ruth</i>; and that sleek mortgagee,
<i>Silley</i>, for whom men like <i>Reuben</i> toil that he may grow fat,
nominally owning their vessels, actually in heavy bondage
to their shrewd exacting masters. There are dark and
deep waters of passion swirling in and out of these simple
lives, and the author, whose method is broadly impressionist
rather than meticulously realistic, contrives cleverly to
suggest that what he imagines has in fact been closely
observed. He can make and tell a story and he can
marshal words with a certain magic. The tragedy ends
peacefully with the resolution of the too bitter discord of
<i>Nesta's</i> hate in love of the child of the man she had wrongfully
and vainly desired. A book to be read.</p>

<hr />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span><p>Amongst the makers of what might be called, without in
this case any disparagement, the commercial short story,
I think I should place Mr. <span class="sc">P. G. Wodehouse</span> as easily my
favourite. The comfortable anticipation that is always
mine on observing his name on the contents page of a
popular magazine has been renewed by the sight of it
attached to a collection of tales in volume form and called,
after the first of them, <i>The Man Upstairs</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>). You
must not expect a detailed criticism. All I can promise
you is that, if you are a Wodehouseite, you will find here
the author at his delightful best. He is winged and doth
range. The heroes of these tales include (I quote from the
cover) "a barber, a gardener, a play-writer, a tramp, a
waiter, a golfer, a stockbroker, a butler, a bank clerk, an
assistant master at a private school, a Peer's son and a
Knight of the Round Table." So there you are; and, if
you don't see what you want in the window, you must be
hard to please. Personally, I fancy I would give my vote
for the play-writing stories. "<i>Experientia</i>," as <i>Mrs.
Micawber's</i> late father used to observe, "<i>does it</i>"; and here
I have the feeling that the
author is upon tried ground.
But not one of the collection
will bore you; there is about
them all too nice a deftness,
too happy a gift of phrase.
I am told by the publishers
that the American public
fully shares my approval of
this engaging craftsman. It
shows their sense. But, if
there is any threat of removing
Mr. <span class="sc">Wodehouse</span> permanently
to the other side of
the Atlantic, where already
he goes far too much, my
guinea shall head any public
subscription to retain him.</p>

<hr />

<p>In an extremely able but
peculiarly unpleasant book,
<i>The Questing Beast</i> (<span class="sc">Secker</span>),
I think that Miss <span class="sc">Ivy Low</span>
makes two serious mistakes.
"Tell her," writes the heroine to a friend after the first of two
irregular love affairs, "that I thought, 'I am not that kind of
girl,' and tell her that there is no 'sort of girl,' and that life
is a sea and human beings must catch hold of life-buoys to
keep them afloat." To this it may be answered, however,
that there <i>is</i> "that kind of girl," and that <i>Rachel Cohen was</i>
"that kind of girl," and that it is a kind which deliberately
rejects life-buoys when flung out to them. The second
mistake, as it seems to me, in a novel which is in many
ways a very clever piece of realism, is a strong feminist or,
at any rate, anti-masculine bias. Against the cunning
dissection of the character of <i>Charles Giddey</i>, a worthless
and conceited egotist, I have no complaint to make. It is
one of the best things of its kind that I have read for
a long time. But it seems unlikely, to say the least, that
the heroine, after being deserted by the man she really
loves, should, considering her very erotic and unprincipled
temperament, find complete happiness in the publication
of a successful novel and in devotion to her child. I feel
that on a nature like that of <i>Rachel Cohen</i> even Royalties
and Press notices would eventually pall. And in pausing
I may remark that the beast <i>Glatisant</i> cuts a very episodic
and unsatisfactory figure in the <i>Morte D'Arthur</i>. Pursued
for a short while by <i>Sir Palamides</i> in his Paynim days, it
scarcely comes into the cognisance of <span class="sc">King Arthur's</span>
Court and the Table Round. And I fancy that the circulating
libraries will feel the same about "<i>The Questing
Beast</i>."</p>

<hr />

<p>I do not think that I can recall any novel that makes
such insistent demands upon the weather as does Miss <span class="sc">Joan
Sutherland's</span> <i>Cophetua's Son</i> (<span class="sc">Mills and Boon</span>). The
sun, the rain, the wind, the snow&mdash;these are from the first
page to the last at their intensest, wildest, brightest, most
furious, and as I closed the book and looked out upon a day
of monotonous drizzle I thanked Heaven for the English
climate. But I imagine that Miss <span class="sc">Sutherland</span> was aware
that nothing but the most vigorous of climatic conditions
would afford a true background for her hero's tempestuous
soul. <i>Lucien de Guise</i> was unfortunate enough to be the
son of a flower-girl, and I had no idea, until Miss
<span class="sc">Sutherland</span> made it plain to me, how terrible his friends
and the members of the smartest of London's clubs&mdash;"Will's,
a place of great historic interest and brilliant
reputation, developing gradually into one of the most exclusive
clubs in London, and
very strictly limited in numbers"&mdash;held
so ignominious
an origin. There is a scene
in Will's where <i>Colonel Maclean</i>,
"a handsome man and
a famous soldier," expels <i>M.
de Guise</i> "with a perceptible
degree of asperity" in his
voice&mdash;a scene that does the
greatest credit to Miss
<span class="sc">Sutherland's</span> imagination.
Indeed, I am afraid that Miss
<span class="sc">Sutherland's</span> ambition to
write a really dramatic story
has driven her into incredibilities
of atmosphere, of
incident, and of character.
<i>M. de Guise</i>, with his flashing,
gleaming eyes, his love
of liqueurs, his passion for
smashing the most priceless
of Nankin vases whenever
he sees them, is, surveyed
under these grey English skies, an unreal figure, and his
world, I am afraid, too brightly coloured to be convincing.</p>
